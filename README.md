Code I (Ryan Stenmark <ryanpstenmark@gmail.com>) wrote for my Intro to Programming Java class at FRCC in 2019.
Assignment problems are from Programming Logic and Design, Fifth Edition, by Tony Gaddis, ISBN 978-0-13-480115-5.

# Organization
Assignments are organized into folders by class week.
Program names follow the convention: Book chapter, _, Problem number.

All programs will compile and run under OpenJDK 1.8.0_191.
All program source code is original and authored by me.
There will be no external dependencies, excluding the OpenJDK development kit and runtime environment.
